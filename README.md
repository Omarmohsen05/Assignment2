//Q1.  Build a Single_Linked_List class. Your class should have the data members:
head, tail, and num_items. Write the following member functions, which perform the same
operations as the corresponding functions in the standard list class:
1) push_front,
2) push_back,
3) pop_front,
4) pop_back,
5) front, back,
6) empty,
7) void insert(size_t index, const Item_Type& item): Insert item at position index
(starting at 0). Insert at the end if index is beyond the end of the list
8) bool remove(size_t index): Remove the item at position index. Return true if
successful; return false if index is beyond the end of the list.
9) size_t find(const Item_Type& item): Return the position of the first occurrence of
item if it is found. Return the size of the list if it is not found.


//Q2. Write a C++ program to implement a stack of integers using a vector with
push and pop operations.
Perform the following operations:
1) Create a stack object.
2) Check the stack is empty or not.
3) Insert some integer values onto the stack.
4) Remove an element from the stack.
4) Find the Top of the stack.
6) Find average value of the stack elements.
